# Employee-Attrition

**Problem Statement**
The issue of keeping one's employees happy and satisfied is a perennial and age-old challenge. If an employee you have invested so much time and money leaves for "greener pastures", then this would mean that you would have to spend even more time and money to hire somebody else.

This project is based on a hypothetical dataset downloaded from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance. It has 1,470 data points (rows) and 35 features (columns) describing each employeeâ€™s background and characteristics; and labelled (supervised learning) with whether they are still in the company or whether they have gone to work somewhere else.

**Expected Outcome**
To understand and determine how these factors relate to workforce attrition.
